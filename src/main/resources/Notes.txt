Dispatcher Servlet:
Dispatcher servlet is the front controller of Spring MVC. So, all the HTTP requests are first received by DS.
It processes the Http Request by following steps:
    ->Identifies correct controller method based on request URL
    ->Executes controller method: Returns model and view name
    ->Identifies correct view using ViewResolver
    ->Executes view
Then it returns the HTTP response.
